        "Critical Writing: net/web Art : “The Work of Art in the age of the internet” my choice of net/web art was Indirect Flights. Mr. Benjamin mentioned in his essay, “The work of Art in the age of its mechanical reproduction” that it is almost human nature to want to copy something so historically the idea of reproduction is not new.The authenticity of an art work is what Benjamin describes as the aura, “a phenomena’s uniqueness” (Benjamin, 2015). His theory suggests that every original piece of art has an aura, for example, “the aura of the sunset, the aura of nature”’ (Benjamin, 2015) that cannot be replaced. Therefore mechanically or technologically reproduced art refuse to appreciate or acknowledge that aura. Benjamin thinks highly of old forms of art, he describes them as creativity and genius. This is because of the value and mystery embedded in them and reproduction undoes that appreciation or status. The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Internet acknowledges the aura that Benjamin talks about but suggests that art on the internet still has evidence of “contemplative emersion” that usually is lost in mechanically reproduced art. This is because when viewing art on the internet we still somehow find ourselves staring. This contemplative imersion is possible because the internet offers tools that allow art to be viewed in different new ways. Digital art pieces can be viewed with music to assist with immersion  just like my case study Indirect Flights. Another tool that the internet offers,  is the ability to view art so closely that you can see the smallest details, “the display system has changed, you see the work better, close ups and etc.” (Carrier, 2020). Art on the internet today has taken this to a whole different level. Danae mentioned that net art today can be seen as clunky, old fashioned or uncool. But I argue that, a piece like Indirect Flight, being able to interact with the artwork in new ways can be seen as a future improvement. The piece is layered with photos, a zooming in and out tool would have been so ideal. With that being said I still think the layers come together so nicely and I was still able to see and appreciate its beauty. REFERENCES- 1.W (1935).

      quote: "After engaging with the readings provided for this topic it became evident that the injustices in the real world are on the web as well. Injustices like discrimination against minorities, inequalities, in this context digital inequality. Digital inequalities of access that has resulted in injustice designing over the last years. In,  TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination, this discrimination by technology in the real world is discussed. Discrimination is closely related to exclusion. Norms that were constructed years ago are still encoded throughout sociotechnical systems in everyday life (Design Justice, 2020). A non-binary Trans, femme-presenting person was put to the side and asked to be searched by a TSA agent after the millimetre wave scanner picked after some abnormalities around their groan area. The agent picked the “female” button between it and the male button for the scan because the traveller was female presenting. The UI only prompted two options, male and female. “These systems are biased against QTI/GNC people” (Design Justice, 2020). This is also a case of mislabelling which is an issue on the web as well. On the web, people are always mislabelled especially minorities. Discussing ethical dilemmas in software engineering over the past few years, Bryan Cantrill talks about an incident that happened in 2015 with Google Photos mislabelling a dark skinned person as a gorilla. These face inaccuracies are also evident in spaces that could result in more harmful consequences to an individual’s life. Past research has shown that has been a great deal of inaccuracies when it comes to people of colour, women and children (Klare at al, 2012 as cited in Buolamwini, Gebru, 2018)Another core issue that I have mentioned above is digital inequalities of access to the internet. The digital divide. According to Maria Tataki and Dimitris Glynos, 202, the digital divide widens this was evident during the pandemic. Only a group of people or of a certain class were able to remotely work at home. This is a disadvantage to those who could not. This is so recent and I think to redress these issues, collective responsibility and effort from the privileged and unprivileged is profound",
