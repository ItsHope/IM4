        "Through this assignment, I was first introduced to React and JSX. It was challenging for me to do the technical aspect of the assignment and I realized that I had not spent enough time preparing for the assignment. A react website is very different from a normal website and the rules are different. I do realize that I did not use the privilege of consulting with my tutors when there was still time. Although I created my website and coded for it, styled it and etc. I was not acknowledging react rules and therefore was unable to get some functionalities. For example, inserting a picture or creating a background image in a normal html website is done in the css file while inserting one in a react website would be done in a jsx file with back ticks that were also new to me too. I quickly had to learn these new things, hooks, using the terminal and etc. I had always pushed my code to GitHub from the GitHub application (GitHub Desktop) from my pc and never needed to use the terminal before now. This was a lot of new information for me all at one with little time. I attempted to learn but I ended up creating more errors while simply trying to deploy my website to GitHub pages. As a result I neglected the theory part of the assignment because my website wasn’t appearing although I was coding for it. As a result I never managed to submit. In conclusion assignment one was my first attempt with react, I planned to do better with assignment 2. ",

        "Through assignment 2, I was able to deploy a website for the first time with the help of my tutors and therefore able to have a bit of understanding in regards to react. I went through all the videos provided and things were starting to make sense. I built the prototype of my website. I still had a lot of hiccups along the way and I had to do extensive research. However assignment 2 proved to be overwhelming because of the workload. I essentially had to do assignment 1 and 2 in one go.  I realized that I was working hard and not smart, I wanted to check off everything off of the brief and realized I could not.  Because I was actually coding for the assignment I faced some technical issues. I wanted an animation on my homepage/landing page. The animation I have right now is not the idea I had, I plan to rectify this on my next assignment. And for my internet artwork, I have exactly what I want in terms of being able to display the images closely but because I am working with images that are not mine. I need to reference and mention the owners. My plan is to add the reference to the website of which the image is from when you view it. I am still trying to work around that. My prototype is also a small percentage of what the ideal internet artwork will look like but I am confident in achieving what I want to do after planning it what on paper.  I also spent an awful amount creating tabs for the website’s blogs. I’ve always thoughts tabs work well when arranging a lot of content neatly. This was my first time using “States”. In conclusion assignment 2 taught me a lot and I got the opportunity to catch up with my classmates even though the assignment is incomplete.   ",

      title: "Assignment 3 Reflection",
      quote:
        "Assignment was a lot easier than assignment 1 and 2 and that is because I already had a site up and I was rectifying all I needed to from the feedback I got from my lecturers. I avoided the br tags that were all over my site that I used for spacing and rather used css to position my content. I worked on the inconsistent use of semicolons and classNames conventions. I made my h1-h6 hieratical and resorted to styling for font size differences. I implemented responsiveness in other pages of my website especially the internet artwork page. My gallery is responsive. I was not able to do the same for other parts of the website but all new website components added from Assignment 2 are responsive including the sliders.  Some feedback I got also included using more react features on my blog. I used UseEffect for the first time for animating my slider and I plan to use it even more in the future. I also used Howler for the first time for assignment 3. I used it for audio playing on my internet artwork page. Even though I wanted my website to be an artwork itself that implements the low exposure aesthetic. My feedback mentioned some difficulties with illegibility because my text colour was so dark. I opted to change font weights to bold to stay true to the theme by not changing colour while still fixing the illegibility difficulties. The biggest challenge I experienced so far was how to fix the issue of having the tabs make my blogs look long which is not good UX. I had my blogs on one page which after sending my website to friends and from the feedback I got, I decided to fix. I acknowledge that the blogs being a long strip of text may have seemed daunting. I wanted to keep the tabs because I had worked hard on them and felt they still grouped all my writings well. This is when I came up with the idea to develop some go to next blog functionality and made the sliders. ",
